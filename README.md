### Game Objectives:
The objective is simple - all that you do is clear the blocks on the screen by shooting at them. There is no win condition, just a end game condition: if your HP displayed in your player character (circle) reaches 0, the game ends. Press reset and then the start button to restart the game.

 <!-- ABOUT THE GAME -->
# About the project
Alice in Wonderland is my first project deliverable for SEIRFX621. It is titled as such because as a first project, it was a lot of ideas, a lot of rabbitholes and a lot of failing successfully before I arrived to the current concept.


## Brainstorming:
Image to come. I err .. threw out some of the chicken scratch pieces of paper with old concepts. I only have what I've got on my ipad.



## Concept: 
The original concept of the game was a snake vs block shooter which had walls forced you into various lanes as an added level of challenge. So when I say "failing successfully", I meant reworking each failure into a part of the game. I think this is relatable to everyone who are new to coding. Even the UI had many changes, what it was originally, only has elements of similarities to the current look. If I had more time, I would love to make it look a lot better.


## Built with: 
HTML, CSS & pure JavaScript


## Roadmap

- [x] Refactor code to reroute gameloop to start button
- [x] Refactor shoot to mouse click
- [x] Attach pause function to space bar 
- [x] Major Feature: Reset button that clears screen & start button that actually restarts the game from fresh
- [x] ReadMe
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Score banner to display the score (the code is already there, just needs an UI to display it)
- [ ] Music Fade-in/out
- [ ] Non-obnoxious bullet sounds
- [ ] Pause image in middle of screen
- [ ] Major feature: Lane Dividers (game mechanic)


## The Code
The core game logic proved to be my most difficult. I didn't know how to create a randomized block spawn. I had arrays set up, an array reshuffle function and a random boolean generator and a lot of scraps of paper/ipad scribbles in attempt to figure out how this might work. At its current state, it runs off of the random boolean generator. In the future, when I figure it out, we'll be able to add more things to the mix - like powerups and dividers!



## Thoughts
In the final revision, I had a moment and decided I wanted a stress free game. So I had a mini brainstorm session about what components spark joy and not stress. Speeding up the game causes stress (you'll see hints of this in the code), scoring might cause stress (turns out my classmates disagree), having to keep an eye on hp might cause stress (actually in-game), having two ways to play this game might minimize stress (ability to break blocks on the screen via colliding AND shooting), music definitely enhances joy (this was added), I didn't like that the music didn't fade out/in on pause though, I sampled bullet sounds and they were all obnoxious, etc. I wanted to improve on the UI because I understand a beautiful UI can also spark joy so that is an ongoing process as well.
