# alice-in-wonderland
Alice in Wonderland is my first project deliverable for SEIRFX621. It is titled as such because as a first project, it was a lot of ideas, a lot of rabbitholes and a lot of failing successfully before I arrived to the current concept.


## Play the game here:

## Game Objectives:
The objective is simple - all that you do is clear the blocks on the screen by shooting at them. There is no win condition, just a end game condition: if your HP displayed in your player character (circle) reaches 0, the game ends.


## Wireframe:
TBD.


## Concept: 
The original concept of the game was a snake vs block shooter which had walls forced you into various lanes as an added level of challenge. So when I say "failing successfully", I meant reworking each failure into a part of the game. I think this is relatable to everyone who are new to coding. Even the UI had many changes, what it was originally, only has elements of similarities to the current look. If I had more time, I would love to make it look a lot better.


### Thoughts
In the final revision, I decided to get away from major concepts of the game - things that make add stress to the game. In the end, I decided I wanted to follow a zen mode type of endless game instead. Because this was a last minute decision, I didn't want to touch core components because they involve some code refactoring. Given the time, I would've wanted to change the concept to simply run into blocks to clear as many as possible and then remove the HP display but keep the shooting as an additional option.
