# alice-in-wonderland
Alice in Wonderland is my first project deliverable for SEIRFX621. It is titled as such because it was a first project, it was a lot of ideas, a lot of rabbitholes and a lot of failing successfully before I arrived to the current concept.


## Play the game here:

## Game Objectives:
The objective is simple - all that you do is clear the blocks on the screen by shooting at them. There is no win condition, just a end game condition: if your HP displayed in your player character (circle) reaches 0, the game ends.
